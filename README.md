This info should change as progress is made on the program. 

### Overview: 
  Program will be a discord bot written in python that will create an image. Hopefully the bot will be able to take in user input 
  (allows user to add line, shape or object to a picture) while createing a picture. 
 
 Notes:
  - User needs to use a python version less than 3.7 to use all current files. Tested as low as 3.5.
  - Libraries used: import random, asyncio, aiohttp, json, discord, Game, discord.ext.commands, Bot

- Files: 
  - DiscordBotTutorial.py: This code allows the bot to respond to a few chat commands such as !hello.
  - AnotherTut.py:  Allows the bot to do a variety of comands such as give an answer to a yes or no question and square a number

### Requirements:
  - Bot takes in an image as a command.
  - Bot creates an image and shows/stores image created.
  - Bot can at least do functions like rotate image, greyscale, and flip image. The bot might also be able to be given commands, 
  like "birdTR"(or something) to be taken as "put a bird in the top right of the image", and return a new image with the command fulfilled.
    - More possible commands: Red scale/color scale, add fonts as in a pervious program.
